### Principle

The source code contains complex inheritances representing abstract mathematical concepts. The system can provide validity certification of mathematical scripts under requirements, since any logical errors or ill definitions can trigger exceptions of the program.

Makefile is provided for compilation. Run output package to see if any exceptions occur. If not, the validity is confirmed. For more introduction, refer to Direction.md under the same directory.
