### License

This project, Universal Mathematics System, is licensed under GPL-3.0.

### Principle

The source code contains complex inheritances representing abstract mathematical concepts. The system can provide validity certification of mathematical scripts written in certain recognizable format, since any logical errors or ill definitions can trigger exceptions of the program.

Makefile is provided for generating the package. Besides, the system is equipped with an enhanced interactive interface based on Python. Run `UnivMaths` in this directory to enter the interface or `UnivMaths FileName` to run scripts. Further guidance please refer to the documentation under Documents directory.
