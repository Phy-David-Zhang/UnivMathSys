## Universal Mathematics System

Universal Mathematics System, or UMS, is an attempt to formulate abstract mathematical theory through computer language.

### Introduction

Mathematics has always been regarded as the most objective subject ever created. However, as it is developing, it looks more and more like a game performed by certain mathematicians. Thus, there comes a question: can mathematics be understood by something else except human being?

Universal Mathematics System intends to give a positive answer to this question by training the computer to understand mathematical theories. As a result, computer can be used to set up a universal criterion for mathematical reasoning, even for those abstract theories.

### Language

Universal Mathematics System utilizes Python as programming language, since its diverse features provide great convenience for reformulating abstract mathematical logic.

All preliminary concepts in Mathematics are formulated as base classes, and all other concepts will be the derived classes. Any inconsistency in mathematical logic will cause exceptions in operating. Therefore, a successful operation without exceptions will provide the validity of mathematical theories.
